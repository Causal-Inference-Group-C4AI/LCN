# Format is the following:
# LCN
# list of sentences, one per line
# label: lower_prob <= P(phi) <= upper_prob for Type 1 ; tau=True/False
# label: lower_prob <= P(phi|psi) <= upper_prob for Type 2
# IMPORTANT: pay attention to spaces between 
# also, the empty lines and the ones starting with # are skipped
# Variables: A, B, C, D, E

s1: 0.1 <= P(B) <= 0.2
